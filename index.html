    <h1>Our mission is to connect fans and their idols. We strive to create unforgettable experiences and out of the box activations for our clients.  </h1>
    <h2>Leave our events feeling like you're on Cloud 9! </h2>
    <p>We are an event planning firm based in West Hollywood, CA. This location gives us the ability to travel to different locations in Los Angeles, as well as surrounding areas, to work with many of the studios and entities located here. Our talented creative team tailors each event to our client's specifications, but we specialize in meet and greets, listening parties, custom release parties, and one on one fan time.</p>
